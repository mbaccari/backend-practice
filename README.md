- I made this initially to practice my backend skills, and quickly found myself wanting to build the front end as well

- This whole project was started with create-react-app, and after that it was from scratch

- Overall this project (which is still in progress) has been a great experience in personal motivation, learning both front and backend skills, and the most important skill, googling and troubleshooting.
